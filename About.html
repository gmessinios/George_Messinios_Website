            text-align: justify;">In this page we have added an interactive diagram. Below we are going to explain the reasons why we have chosen that diagram to display.
            To begin with, that diagram shows us a lot of information at the same time and enables the reader to interact with the diagram by changing the values ​​of the 
            parameters and seeing more specific results that may concern him. For example, someone can see the place, the year and the magnitude of the earthquakes that 
            have been placed between the time period 1965 to 2016. Apart from the details that are labeled for each earthquake, the time dimension is a very significant 
            variable that allows us to understand the changes of the eartquakes in each country over the time. Also, another argument is that Greece belongs to seismogenic 
            countries and that fact affect me to choose this diagram for my website. As you can see Greece has numerous earthquakes over the years and from that diagram we can 
            inform and collect a lot of information about each one and interact with a set of variables (For example region, year, magnitude, depth, type and occurence of each 
            eartquake).</p>
