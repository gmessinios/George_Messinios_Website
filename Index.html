                It is our honour for visiting our website. Let me introduce myself. My name is George Messinios, I am 25 years old and I have studied
                Statistics and Insurance Science in University of Piraeus. I started my studies in October of 2015 and I finished in June of 2019. After I 
                passed all required lessons I made my practice in Generalli Hellas A.E for two months in the compensation section. I can say that it was a 
                very interesting experience. After that I served my military service in Lesvos from September of 2020 to May of 2021 and then I started my
                postgraduate studies in National and Kapodistrian University of Athens at the department of Informatics and Telecommunications. I chose Big 
                Data due to the fact that I wanted to combine Statistics science and Informatics science in order to gain a wider perspective in Data Science.</p><br>
